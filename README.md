ROYAL IMAGE GALLERY- CARS & HORSES
A Stunning Visual Experience Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Welcome to one of the most visually appealing web projects I've worked on—an interactive image gallery that combines the elegance of luxury cars and the grace of majestic horses. This gallery isn't just about images; it's about creating a smooth, immersive, and refined experience using only core front-end technologies. From the moment the page loads, users are welcomed with a premium dark-golden theme, polished animations, and responsive design that works beautifully across all devices.

OVERVIEW:
This project demonstrates my skills as a front-end developer by focusing on UI design, interactivity, and performance. The gallery allows users to explore images with a real-time filter system and a lightbox feature that adds depth to the viewing experience. It's a balance between simplicity and style, crafted without relying on external libraries—just clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

FEATURES:
Elegant dark-themed UI with golden highlights
Filter functionality (Cars, Horses, or Show All)
Lightbox image preview with a smooth overlay
Animated hover effects for interactive feedback
Fully responsive layout for desktop and mobile
Clean and maintainable codebase

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
HTML5 – Semantic structure and layout
CSS3 – Responsive design, transitions, animations, and styling
JavaScript – Filter logic and lightbox functionality
Media Queries – Adaptive design for various screen sizes

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
The entire visual theme was inspired by a desire to blend richness with minimalism. I chose a linear gradient background, glowing shadows, and smooth transitions to keep the interface engaging without overwhelming the user. Every hover effect, border, and animation is meant to elevate the gallery while keeping performance intact.

LEARNING OUTCOME:
This project deepened my understanding of front-end development, especially in creating a fully interactive user interface with vanilla JavaScript and CSS animations. It also helped me improve my approach to responsive web design and user-centered experiences.

Whether you're passionate about sleek cars or powerful horses, this gallery brings them to life in a beautiful, responsive, and interactive way. I'm proud of how this project turned out, and it serves as a reflection of my eye for design, attention to detail, and growth as a front-end developer.
